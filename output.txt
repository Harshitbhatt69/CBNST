Enter max. number of iterations =>Enter the value of a and b(starting boundary)=>

Roots lie between 0.000000 and 1.000000

Correct function form. Iteration method can be applied

Iteration = 1,Root = 0.816497
Iteration = 2,Root = 0.741964
Iteration = 3,Root = 0.757671
Iteration = 4,Root = 0.754278
Iteration = 5,Root = 0.755007
Iteration = 6,Root = 0.754850
Iterations =7, Final root=0.754884
